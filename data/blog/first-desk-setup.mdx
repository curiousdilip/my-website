## Overview

A post on my first ever desk setup  ðŸš€ðŸš€

This is the first time, that I have an organized desk setup, with some new gadgets. This setup will most likely change in some way over the time, when I get more comfortable my new setup.

Here we have the specs for my new machine

-   **Type**: Assembled PC
-   **Size**: 19.5" Monitor
-   **Chip**: Ryzen 3 2200G
-   **RAM**: 16 GB
-   **HHD**: 1 TB
-   **SSD**: 140GB
-   **OS**: Windows 10

For comparsion here are the specs for my old machine

-   **Type**: Acer Desktop 
-   **Size**: 14"
-   **Chip**: AMD A4
-   **RAM**: 4 GB
-   **HHD**: 1TB
-   **OS**: Windows 10

My old machine was in a no sense a bad machine, I love  it, as it was my first PC gifted by my Dad. It looks great, but the performance was not as good as my latest one. The small form factor of using SSD is great.

However, my new setup is so much faster than my old machine. By very rough calculations it was almost 10x faster to start up a live server on my work project.
