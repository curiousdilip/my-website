We can add an event listener to the document's contextmenu event and prevent its default behavior.

```js
document.addEventListener('contextmenu', function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
});
```
The JavaScript portion adds an event listener to the contextmenu event, which triggers when the user tries to right-click. Inside the event listener, we call preventDefault() on the event object to prevent the browser's default context menu from appearing.

Note that while this approach can deter casual users from right-clicking, it won't prevent determined users from accessing your content through other means. Also, keep in mind that disabling right-click goes against typical web browsing behavior and might lead to a poor user experience.
